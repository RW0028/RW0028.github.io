  <!-- About -->
  <h2 id="about">About</h2>

  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis, pursuing a double major
    in Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior and Music. I am on a neuron-centered neuroscience track,
    with primary academic interests in understanding neural systems at the neuronal and circuit
    levels and how neural activity gives rise to physiological function.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a pre-med student, I approach neuroscience not only as an intellectual pursuit, but also as a
    discipline closely connected to human health and clinical reality. This perspective motivates my
    focus on mechanisms that bridge neural activity and physiological function, while maintaining a
    long-term interest in translational relevance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my core academic training in neuroscience, I maintain a sustained engagement with
    music as a parallel discipline. This background informs how I think about human experience and
    expression, while my academic and research trajectory remains firmly grounded in neuroscience
    and neural systems.

  <!-- Research -->
  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Current Research.</strong>
      Research assistant in a neuroscience laboratory, focusing on neuron-centered questions
      in neural systems and physiology, with emphasis on neuronal and circuit-level mechanisms.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Past Research Experience.</strong>
      Prior experience in computational and engineering-oriented neuroscience (dry lab),
      involving data analysis and modeling approaches. This work has concluded and helped
      clarify my preference for biologically grounded, neuron-focused research.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Early Research Experience.</strong>
      Research on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, focusing on Alzheimer’s disease and
      the role of microglia in neural pathology. Topics included endoplasmic reticulum stress,
      oxidative stress, autophagic–lysosomal pathways, and neuroinflammation.
