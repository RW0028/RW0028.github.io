  <!-- About -->
  <h2 id="about">About</h2>

  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis,
    pursuing a double major in Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior and Music.
    I am on a neuron-centered neuroscience track, with primary academic interests
    in understanding neural systems at the neuronal and circuit levels and how
    neural activity gives rise to physiological function.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a pre-med student, I approach neuroscience not only as an intellectual pursuit,
    but also as a discipline closely connected to human health and clinical reality.
    This perspective motivates my focus on mechanisms that bridge neural activity
    and physiological function, while maintaining a long-term interest in translational
    relevance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my core academic training in neuroscience, I maintain a sustained engagement
    with music as a parallel discipline. This background informs how I think about human
    experience and expression, but my academic and research trajectory is firmly grounded
    in neuroscience and neural systems.

  <!-- Research -->
  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>

  <h3>Current Research</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Research assistant in a neuroscience laboratory at UC Davis, focusing on neural
      systems and physiology-related questions with an emphasis on neuronal-level mechanisms,
      including literature review and neural signal analysis.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Past Research Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Prior research experience in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, with a focus on
      Alzheimer’s disease and the role of microglia in neural pathology. This work examined
      cellular stress responses, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress,
      autophagic–lysosomal pathways, and neuroinflammation, and resulted in a conference
      paper presentation.
      <br>
      <em>
        “Different Roles of Microglia in Alzheimer’s Disease,” International Conference on
        Biological Engineering and Medical Science (ICBioMed), 2023.
      </em>
    </li>

    <li>
      Past research experience in engineering- and computation-oriented projects,
      primarily involving dry-lab and data-driven analysis. This work contributed to my
      technical foundation and exposure to quantitative approaches, though my current
      academic interests have since shifted toward neuroscience and neuron-centered
      biological questions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Activities -->
  <h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Music Performance:</strong>
      Classically trained cellist with long-term ensemble experience, currently performing
      with the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra. Music has been a sustained part of my education
      and informs my understanding of human expression, discipline, and collaboration.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Athletics & Leadership:</strong>
      Founder of the ITF Taekwon-Do club at UC Davis, responsible for organizing regular
      training sessions and coordinating club activities. Long-term martial arts training
      has emphasized consistency, self-regulation, and instructional responsibility.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Service & Care:</strong>
      Volunteer with YoloCares, providing companionship and psychosocial support for patients
      in end-of-life care. This experience has strengthened my patient-centered perspective
      and reinforced my motivation to pursue medicine.
    </li>
  </ul>
