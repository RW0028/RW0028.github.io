    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>
      I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis,
      pursuing a double major in Neurobiology, Physiology &amp; Behavior and Music.
      I am on a neuron-centered neuroscience track, with primary academic interests
      in understanding neural systems at the neuronal and circuit levels and how
      neural activity gives rise to physiological function.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a pre-med student, I approach neuroscience not only as an intellectual pursuit,
      but also as a discipline closely connected to human health and clinical reality.
      This perspective motivates my focus on mechanisms that bridge neural activity
      and physiological function, while maintaining a long-term interest in translational
      relevance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside my core academic training in neuroscience, I maintain a sustained engagement
      with music as a parallel discipline. This background informs how I think about human
      experience and expression, but my academic and research trajectory is firmly grounded
      in neuroscience and neural systems.

    <h3>Current Research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Research assistant in a neuroscience laboratory at UC Davis, focusing on neural
        systems and physiology-related questions with an emphasis on neuronal-level mechanisms,
        including literature review and neural signal analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Past Research Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prior research experience in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, with a focus on
        Alzheimer’s disease and the role of microglia in neural pathology. This work examined
        cellular stress responses, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress,
        autophagic–lysosomal pathways, and neuroinflammation, and resulted in a conference
        paper presentation.

          “Different Roles of Microglia in Alzheimer’s Disease,” International Conference on
          Biological Engineering and Medical Science (ICBioMed), 2023.
        </em>
      </li>

      <li>
        Past research experience in engineering- and computation-oriented projects,
        primarily involving dry-lab and data-driven analysis. This work contributed to my
        technical foundation and exposure to quantitative approaches, though my current
        academic interests have since shifted toward neuroscience and neuron-centered
        biological questions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Music Performance:</strong>
        Classically trained cellist with long-term ensemble experience, currently performing
        with the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra. Music has been a sustained part of my education
        and informs my understanding of human expression, discipline, and collaboration.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Athletics &amp; Leadership:</strong>
        Founder of the ITF Taekwon-Do club at UC Davis, responsible for organizing regular
        training sessions and coordinating club activities. Long-term martial arts training
        has emphasized consistency, self-regulation, and instructional responsibility.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Service &amp; Care:</strong>
        Volunteer with YoloCares, providing companionship and psychosocial support for patients
        in end-of-life care. This experience has strengthened my patient-centered perspective
        and reinforced my motivation to pursue medicine.
